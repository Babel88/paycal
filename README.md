# paycal
a small cli calculator

Admit it, once you get the hang of using a keyboard a GUI calculator, will always be slower than a command-line interface. This little calculator should be off the ground in seconds and you are ready to compute a new payment, one key stroke and enter key later. It's written in java, so sometimes there is a little warmup but other than that this little bugger is good for common payment computations right off the keyboard
